Inheritance ✅ single level
Syntax : -
class Parentclass:
    def __init__(self, arg1):
        self.argument1 = arg1

class Childclass(Parentclass):
    def __init__(self, child_arg1):
        self.child_argument = child_arg1

# Inheritance : -
# Inheritance is fundamental concept of an OOPs that allow to create a new class based on existing class


# Parents class : -
# Parents class is the class in which we inherit attributes(property) and method to the child class
# It is commonly known as Existing class, superclass, parent class or  base class


# Child class : -
# Child class is a class that inherits properties (attributes) and methods from another class.
# It is commonly known as new class, subclass, child class or derived class .

# Note : -
# We use override method in child class from parents class means modify the behaviour of __init__().
# To do this modification we define an __init__() method in the child class. and if we want to keep
# the parent's constructor behavior, call the parent's __init__() using super() function


# Types of Inheritance in Python :-
# ➡ Single Inheritance
# ➡ Multiple Inheritance
# ➡ Multi-level Inheritance
# ➡ Hierarchical Inheritance
# ➡ Hybrid Inheritance


# Why use inheritance :-
# It promotes code reusability and helps organize your code by creating a hierarchy of related classes.
# It provides modularity, maintenance, polymorphism and Efficiency Boost in the programs.


# What is Super function : -
# super() is a built-in function that provides a way to access methods of a parent class from a child class
# super() allows to call a method in the parent class that we are overridden in the child
# when we call super(), it doesn't return a value directly. it returns a proxy object that allows you to call methods from a parent or superclass.
# super() uses the method resolution order (MRO) to find the next class in line.
# It’s especially useful in multiple inheritance to ensure cooperative method calls.
